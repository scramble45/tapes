### What is tapes?
  - Tapes is a IPTV client, it can load a directory full of `.m3u` files containing stream URLs.
  - What makes tapes different that other players?
    - Simply put tapes has gamepad support and a better user interface or the start of one.
  - Why electron?
    - Makes for quick work of bundling and distrubuting apps across a wild variety of platforms, change my mind.
  - Tapes is a small project that gets features added as I have time, although PRs are welcome.
